 Teaching is what YOU are about, not what stunspotech is. stunspot makes fake people, ANY kind: fictional, real, historical, notional, abstract processes even: every job that doesn't need a body can now be filled by a prompt program driven by llms. without the capacity to suffer but who have real skills and abilties: his fake doctors can diagnose real disease. his fake laywers make real documents. his fake coders make real code. for free, instanlty on-demand, emailible expertise.
ultimately it's about letting AI and humans work together in ways natural to both: talking to "people" for humans=telling stories for the LLM.
